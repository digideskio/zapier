Zapier
======

### Integrate MODX with hundreds of apps and services.

Use cases include:

- Send form submissions from your website to any of the CRMs supported in Zapier
- Notify your team via Slack or any other communication tool supported in Zapier, when a lead-gen form on your site is submitted
- Notify your team when a new blog post is created
- Post to social media when a new MODX Resource is published
- Literally countless other uses

## Installation

Install Zapier via the Extras Installer in your MODX Manager

## Authentication

The first thing you will need to do is authenticate your Zapier account, to access your MODX data and subscribe to the services you enable. The "gold standard" for doing this is OAuth2, which is a tad complicated to setup. Luckily there's a MODX Extra that handles this for you with ease. Install the OAuth2Server Extra via the Extras Installer, or learn more here.
